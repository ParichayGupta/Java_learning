        * INTERFACES
        * - We cannot create object of an interface.
        * - All methods in an interface are public and abstract by default.
        * - We cannot make methods with body inside an interface.
        *
        * Can Interface have Instance Variables ?
        * - Yes we can have instance variables in an interface but
        *   - that variable will be of no use
        *   - bcz if we do not initialise that variable we cannot
        *       have a getter, setter, constructor or any method with body to initialise it.
        *   - and if we initialise that variable there only then also it will be of no use
        *     as we cannot create object of an interface. and we cannot call that variable.
