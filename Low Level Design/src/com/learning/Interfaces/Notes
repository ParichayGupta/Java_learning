INTERFACES
An interface is a reference type that is similar to a class.

CONSTRUCTOR
- We cannot create constructor in an Interface as we cannot create it's object.

METHODS
1. Abstract Methods: A method without body.
    - Interface can have abstract methods, which are mandatory to override by the class implementing the interface.
    - for example: int exampleMethod();
2. Default Methods:
    - Interface can have default methods.
    - There can be as many default methods, as we want.
    - Not mandatory but can be overridden by child class.
    - for example: default int exampleMethod(){ return 0;}
3. static methods:
    - Interface can have static methods.
    - There can be as many static methods, as we want.
    - Cannot override a static method in child class.
    - for example: static String exampleMethod(){
                        return "Ram";
                   }

VARIABLES

Can Interface have Instance Variables ?
- Yes we can have instance variables in an interface but
    - They are public static and final by default, so we need to initialise them there only and
    we cannot change its value.
